Subject: [PATCH] serializer/samples: Disable devicetwin_simplesample

There is a wild error when compile it:
$ $CC devicetwin_simplesample.c
devicetwin_simplesample.c:54:1: error: macro "MU_IF1" requires 2 arguments, but only 1 given
devicetwin_simplesample.c:54:1: error: macro "MU_IF1" passed 5 arguments, but takes just 2

It reports two different errors in the same line with one compile command, I
used "gcc -E", but can't figure out the reason, the macro definitions are very
complicated which may make it not work for cross compiling, so disable it.
